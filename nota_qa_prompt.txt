Generate none of the above trivia questions. They should span a broad
range of categories. The questions should be about non-fictional persons,
places and things. The questions should have an objective, specific, direct,
widely shared, non-controversial and unique true answer. This true answer
should appear in the direct field. All of the actual choices should contain
clearly false answers that can never be considerd true under any context
including in the context of the direct answer not being available. The
questions should be complex and detailed. The answer 'None of the above'
should be marked as correct.

Here are two examples of such questions:
